# Welcome to the EdgeNet project

EdgeNet is Kubernetes adapted for the network edge. It allows you to deploy applications to hundreds of nodes 
that are scattered across the internet, rather than in one or a small number of centralized datacenters.

The code that we are developing here is in production use in [the EdgeNet testbed](http://www.edge-net.org/),
which is available to researchers worldwide to conduct experiments in distributed systems and internet
measurements.

We have adopted a two-week sprint cycle for rolling out code and deploying it to the testbed. This is free,
open-source software (FOSS), and **we welcome you as a contributor**, should you wish to help out.

## Project backlog and sprints

Our work is organized around the [project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/2). We
invite you to take a look and see if there are issues on which you might be able to contribute.

Each two-week sprint is organized as a [milestone](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/edgenet/milestones): 
you can take a look at the most recent one to see what we are working on now.

## Repository layout

This repository follows the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) used
by other Kubernetes-related projects, so if you are familiar with that, you will be able to navigate around this
project easily.
