This is the May 2nd 2020 version of the EdgeNet logo.

There is a rectangular version with text (the font is [Ubuntu Bold 700](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?sidebar.open&selection.family=Ubuntu:wght@700)):

<img src="edgenet_logo_w_text_100dpi.png" alt="100 DPI logo with text" height="100"/>

And a square version without text:

<img src="edgenet_logo_no_text_100dpi.png" alt="100 DPI logo without text" height="100"/>

The master file for creating the logo variants is an OmniGraffle file, though the SVG file should work just as well if you do not have the OmniGraffle application.

The logo is available here in 100, 300, and 600 DPI PNG and in PDF versions, all with transparent background.
